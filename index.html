    <h2>Where are we?</h2>
    <br />


    <p>

      Panorama apartments are situated in the village called Dragove on the island of Dugi Otok just off the coast of Zadar. The island itself is 44,5 km long and consists of 12 villages. We are in the quiet village with just a small number of
      inhabitants and  therefore this is a great serenity retreat from the outside world. The island is renowned for not being a commercial navel and for its unspoiled nature. It is very popular among cyclists, divers and adventurers.
      We have 5 fully fitted apartments that feature 3 hot tubs, a sun deck with beautiful sea view and kayaks & bicycles. Please refer to our <a href="offers.html">Offers</a> page for the  detailed info about the apartments and the  prices.</p>

    <h2>What to do on Dugi Otok</h2>
    <br />
    <p>

      There is a big difference whether you are visiting in the summer, or out of the main season.
      If you are visiting in the summer there are plenty of activities for you to engage with. A bit different story is if you are visiting outside of the season. Normally, there is nothing much to do but to enjoy the silence and to unwind, that is
      where we excel. With two hot tubs, sauna, three kayaks and a few workout machine, we offer you a serenity with just enough to do so you are not bored.

    <h3>Lighthouse Veli Rat</h3>
    <br />
    <p>

       is 13 km from us and it is the tallest lighthouse in the whole Adriatic.  The site is the go - to place for many romantic souls to do weddings and photo sessions, due to its amazing sunset and breathtaking view.  There is a beach in the
      vicinity and about 1 km from the shore is the location of the shipwreck that sank in 1984. It is a very popular site for snorkeling and diving. It is accessible by boat or kayak,  and it is equally popular in the summer and outside of the main
      season.</p>

    <h3> Golubinka sea cave</h3> <p>
      <br />
      is around 10 km away and it is only accessible by sea. It is a great  destination for kayak enthusiasts  and dive adventurers in the summer time and outside of  the main season. Usually the starting point is Brbiscica beach, where you can lay
      down for a sunbath and take a swim. It is 450 meters from the cave.

    <h3> Strasna pec</h3>
    <br />
    <p>

       is a cave around 18 km from us and it is an interesting  geological and historical destination. The path leading to the entrance  is quite rough and it is advisable to

      leave your car near the main road and walk the rest of the way, which is around 2,5 km long. It is good for cycling and trekking, the view is breathtaking.</p>
